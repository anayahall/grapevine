 NOTES

 ###################################################################


- BUFFERS: base on roadway netowrk - 50 miles --> 
- PARAMETERS for soil application - 
	--> (exclude certain properties of land (ie SLOPE)?)
- calculate % and absolute (m2) rangeland and % and absolute (m2) area cropland
- LATEr can add # of farm operations and compare operatiosn (but these are all county level)
- look at other uses (ie A/D - econ part done?)
- add PERMITS
- incentivizing collection, requiring ag to purchase?

TO DO

###################################################################

#  ==> also, need to find more papers on RDM!! (to-do Wednesday)
-- finish reading calrecycle report

-- dl new SWIS ??

 - question: proportion of state-owned v privately-owned land?




###################################################################
# IDEAS FROM DRAFT 1283 Infrastructure & Market Analysis ######
###################################################################
# COMPETING GOALS OF AIR CONTROL AND (the governor) CALRECYLCE - HOW TO APPEASE
# ^^ could I use RDM to measure success here???
# IN DISCUSSION could also discuss noncongruous goals of local city planning departments (ie zoning) and 

# COST OF IMPLEMENTING?	
# 


########### QUESTIONS FOR NEIL EDGAR ###########################
FOR WS:
 - Advice on dealing with storage (tied to interannual feedstock variability)?
 - Operational costs, average expenditures and income?
 - My data is in BDT - should I convert before feeding into processing module\

***converstion factor of finished compost is 50% moisture (or a little less on average) - 
- REGIONAL

 - Is it valuable to model proposed facility expansion (perhaps at existing non-composting SWIS sites) or at optimal locations elsewhere


FROM REPORT:
1. how did he solve the capacity units issue - "cubic yards limitations" ----------> maybe ask HANNA B about this too
	- what conversion from volume to weight did he use? I saw 2.24 cubic yards per ton compost somewhere, but have also seen 1.4??
 -- MATT COTTON did the number crunching! how to blend? fundamentally sold by cubic yard but sw monitored by tons

 (matt@mattcotton.com - 530.305.2060) >> CALL SOON! 

 - there are some standard conversion rates, depends on moisture content, 800-1100 lbs per cubic yard (950) 
 - difficulty is discerning what types of facilities are actually producing compost, some have the permit but mostly producing woody facilities, they do stockpile the  material on site (if above 122F - technically produce compost!)
  --- ex) mallard creek in rockland, make animal bedding!
  ---- talk to Bob Horowitz at CalRecycle -- technical expert

  -- either might have a paired down list of actually compost
  if 12500 cu yard facillity, as a rule those are windrow, manage roughly 4 cycles per year, (less microbial activity than forced air) - roughly 50,000 cu yard /year - mostly just green-waste
  - cal recylce has FACIT conversion chart for a whole range of materials! 

2. is weight/volume pre-processing of compost or post (is it a measure of 'waste' or of 'compost')
 - permitted facillity if weight based its based on incoming tonnage (recology 2000 tons/day); if volume, more about wht's on site

3. biomass facility closures due to renewable energy - negative impact on composting 
	-- spiraling impact on compost revenue? high-hazard forest waste mgmt plan (gov brown) - put lots of money to moving into biomass ($120 mil) plants, but this crowds out ag materials and especially urban materials (who have no other option) - ag can still burn
	C&D debris operators no longer have markets for their wood (tanker wood north san jose, 400 tons a day to manage - 20 full transfer trailors) >>> NEED TO HAVE THIS AS A Market
	- plants may not be as clean as they could be (need regulation) but still need to maintain capacity, ratepayers or tax-payers will have to pay!!!!!!
	- many located in disadvangated communities (solar 2ind 4-6c/kwh, 12c/kwh for biomass)
	> utilities no longer buying biomass fuel, 
	> sprang up in 80s on gov subsidies to limit ag burning, forest burning, the option was to create ENERGY and reduced
	  air pollution by 95%
	  not as efficient as they could be though, and they will walk away 

4. diversion credit?? vs. greenhouse gas credit -- what is this?

5. Tipping fees - how did they adjust?

---> ask MATT COTTON may have had input from CalRecycle
- industry as a whole -  AB1826 for COMMERCIAL have to have organics diversions kicked in this year 
- that program implementation is slowing changing the industry
- 1383 will ramp it up even further, 

 - 3 years ago could have paid recoloy vernalis $35/ton, now muncipal contracts are $50 and heading up
  -- rsp for sunnyvale $65/ton
  - part is facillity operators are subject to new discharge requirements from water board

--- urban paying rural - reasonalble approach/question; beneftis are apparent but its an economic issue, how to fund these programs, its still not clear.

- look at it from economics: compost generally sold for between $10-30/ton, pretty well set, high end is landscaping/erosion control, farms pay $10 bc its all they can afford
- with diversion mandates, looking at doubling of volume, what will happen to the price? def not going to increase it!
- where are the incentives, financial mechanisms 

NOTES from NEIL (MATT is co-author) 
 - tipping fees covers mostly O&M, any
  - transportation and spreading costs not built into tipping fees - how to incporporate
  - dairy manure composted and applied in other areas but no money flows 
  - he's working on bill that would have SGC look at cross-sector inmpacts, forest lands, sw, manure, pruning, 
  	modoc county has both
  	(uc davis has done some of this rob williams group, decade of information on) - energy, nutrient cycles back to the soil, rangelands, croplands
  	CARB report of implications of 1383- recommended that the majority of facilities be located close to generation (urban centers, but lots of the waste not produced in urban areas more)
  	- transportation impacts not often considered
  # californians agaisnt waste (mostly recycling, but also organics)  - led by Nick Lappis, need regional, local, on-farm and everything!
   - depends on the local economies/communities - combination of all the 
CDFA white paper on compost usage, what they could subsidize on healthy soils program (lack of info on what are the benfits to soil) - they're CA focused so what specific data
the BILL- what is the 30,000 foot view! need integrative cross-sector understanding

- working lands innovation center, shelby livingston from CARB worked on natural and working lands implementation program, she said they're not adding ag lands compost applications to program -- why????
circular economies/nutrient cycling
>>> CHECK THIS? numbers on potential usage for croplands! 

########### QUESTIONS FOR JEFF ###########################
 - good RATIO for good compost!
